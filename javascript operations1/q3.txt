Unary Binary and Ternary operators

Unary operates on single operand

eg: let x = "5"
        y = +x // it changes x to number 
        y = -x // -5
    (increament,Decreament,typeof etc are unary operator)

Binary operates on two operands

eg: comparision operator,logical operator,arithmetic operators etc.

Ternary operates on three operands

eg: 5>6 ? "hii" : "hello"
